Minesweeper is a game where mines are hidden in a grid of squares. Safe squares have numbers
telling you how many mines touch the square. You can use the number clues to solve the game by
opening all of the safe squares.If you open a mine you lose the game!

You open squares with the left mouse button and put flags on mines with the right mouse button.

When you open a square that does not touch any mines, it will be empty and the adjacent squares
will automatically open in all directions until reaching squares that contain numbers.

The three difficulty levels are Beginner (8x8 or 9x9 with 10 mines), Intermediate (16x16 with 40 mines)
and Expert (30x16 with 99 mines). The game ends when all safe squares have been opened. A counter shows
the number of mines without flags, and a clock shows your time in seconds. Minesweeper saves your best
time for each difficulty level.
